GBA processor type: 32bit ARM7tdmi
Instruction sets:
	ARM:
		- multifunctional
		- can incorporate a shift instruction within
		- opcode length fixed at 32 bits
		- all opcodes can be executed conditionally
        - slower than THUMB in ROM

	THUMB:
		- usually one function
		- opcode length fixed at 16 bits
		- only branches can be conditional
		- can't turn condition setting off

Registers:
	- 16 32bit registers
	- first 7 (r0 to r6) are available in THUMB mode
	- r0 - r12: general purpose registers (GPR)
	-      r13: ususally a stack pointer; if no stack is used: consider this to be a GPR
	-      r14: link register to hold return addresses for branch and link instructions (sub-routine calls); can be used as a GPR
	-      r15: PC register; holds the address +8 of current instruction (ARM7 has a 3 stage pipeline:
	       ARM       THUMB
	       PC        PC        Fetch
	       PC - 4    PC - 2    Decode
	       PC - 8    PC - 4    Execute

Patater tutorials (https://patater.com/gbaguy/gba/ch2.htm) use arm-elf-gcc and arm-elf-objcopy. Replace there with arm-none-eabi-gcc and arm-none-eabi-objcopy, respectively (https://devkitpro.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=8660). To be found in the %DEVKITPRO%\devkitARM\bin folder. The commands to compile and link:

arm-none-eabi-gcc -o test.elf -specs=gba.specs test.S	// compile test.S to test.elf
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary test.elf test.gba		// copy binary file to another format https://manned.org/arm-none-eabi-objcopy#head3
gbafix test.gbafix 										// The gbafix.exe tool is needed to generate a valid GBA header (needed when running the binary file on actual hardware)

Notes on alignment:
	- align your data; use .align .align 4, 16bit = .align 2 (UNCLEAR!)
	- memory access is slow; use registers (use a MOV and ADD to load a 32bit value, instead of an LDR from ROM)


ARM addressing modes
--------------------

ARM data sizes
--------------
 WORD     = 32 bits
 HALFWORD = 16 bits
 BYTE     =  8 bits
(NIBBLE   =  4 bits)

MEMORY FORMATS
--------------
The ARM7TDMI processor is bi-endian (traditionally the default format is little endian)
Numbers are calculated by the CPU starting with the least significant digits so little-endian numbers are already set up for the processing order.

ARM Instruction set
-------------------
ADD
	- store SUM of second and third operand in first operand
	- optional shift of last operand
	- format: INSTRUCTION DEST, OPERAND2, OPERAND3 [, SHIFTER OP #Number or Register]
	- add s to instruction to set status flags

AND
	- store logical AND of second and third operand in first operand
	- optional shift of last operand
	- format: INSTRUCTION DEST, OPERAND2, OPERAND3 [, SHIFTER OP #Number or Register]
	- add s to instruction to set status flags

BIC (UNSURE WHEN THIS WOULD BE USEFUL)
	- store logical AND of second and third operand in first operand
	- bit set in second operand are cleared in the first (&~: and followed by bit inversion)
	- optional shift of last operand
	- format: INSTRUCTION DEST, OPERAND2, OPERAND3 [, SHIFTER OP #Number or Register]
	- add s to instruction to set status flags

CMP
	- compare first and second operand and stores result in status flag
	- never modifies the registers

EOR
	- store exclusive OR of second and third operand in first operand
	- optional shift of last operand
	- format: INSTRUCTION DEST, OPERAND2, OPERAND3 [, SHIFTER OP #Number or Register]
	- add s to instruction to set status flags

LDMIA
	- load multiple registers
	- uses comma-separated list of low registers or low-register ranges (r0 - r7)
	- http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0068b/BABEFCIB.html

LDRB
	- load a byte
	- (zero-extend fills the upper bits with 0)

LDR
	- load (read) a value from memory
	- ldr r0,=0x32bitnumber

LDRH
	- load halfword

LDRSH
	- load a signed halfword
	- (sign-extend fills the upper bits with the highest bit of the loaded value)

MOV
	- move numbers between registers
	- can include a shift operation
	- mov reg1, reg2 {LSL, LSR, ASR, RORO, RRX #X}
	- mov reg1, reg1 ; NOP
	- MOV is needed to shift a number; no standalone shift operation is available

ORR
	- store bitwise OR of second and third operand in first operand
	- optional shift of last operand
	- format: INSTRUCTION DEST, OPERAND2, OPERAND3 [, SHIFTER OP #Number or Register]
	- add s to instruction to set status flags

STR
	- store (write) a value into memory
	- NB restrictions on literal value for STR and MOV the number should be created by shifting up a byte sized value

STRH
	- store a halfword

STRB
	- store a byte

SUB
	- store result of subtracting third from second operand in first operand
	- optional shift of last operand
	- format: INSTRUCTION DEST, OPERAND2, OPERAND3 [, SHIFTER OP #Number or Register]
	- add s to instruction to set status flags

SUBR
	- reverse subtraction
	- store result of subtracting secong from third operand in first operand
	- optional shift of last operand
	- format: INSTRUCTION DEST, OPERAND2, OPERAND3 [, SHIFTER OP #Number or Register]
	- add s to instruction to set status flags
